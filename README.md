# CS-210-Project3


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?


This project was to make a grocery store intventory and purchase tracking program. Meant to show how many times was purcahsed in a day and what was left of these items. 
it would then print out to the frequncy.dat file showing what items was purchased.

What did you do particularly well? 

What I believe I did well is making a fully function code that is clean and concise so that it can be very easily read even with the combination for the 2 languages.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

what would enhance my code is furthering my knowledge in both languages and thus be able to make a cleaner looking code and also the ability do more in less while using less code


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? 

What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? The toughest part for me was matching up C++ with the python as C++ is a tougher language for me. I have been adding a group with programmers who have been in the career for a while who are willing to answer questions to people who are just getting started in the industry.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

the biggest take away from this project is the combination of the 2 languages in this way which will help in the future when I have to do to projects like this in my field. I will be able to look back on this project for ideas.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

I did this with correct spacing of each section and good indentation but also left it open to being changed if needed if someone needed to adapt this code for some other work project
